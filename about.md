Ben is a mystery, wrapped in an enigma, wrapped in a taco shell, covered in dairy free sauce.

This is my website, it is a bit frivolous, decidedly light hearted and straight-up.

## My work
I do technology policy, Internet advocacy and project stuff for InternetNZ, a charity that works towards a Better World, through a Better Internet (and is the ccTLD for .nz). I have a background in public policy and have worked for the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Justice, NZ Police, Real Estate Agents Authority and the Department of Internal Affairs. 

A national expert on Coordinated Disclosure I [wrote the guidelines](http://nzitf.org.nz/coordinated-disclosure/) on coordinated disclosure in New Zealand. 

## My Study
I’m a student of geopolitical strategy. Which mostly nails my colours to the mast. I’m a bit of a realist, but as someone in a small state, I tend to be quite an Institutionalist in my realism. I predominantly think and write about how and when strategy and the Internet collide. I’ve used Trello to map out my dissertation and I’m writing in public in a github repo here.

## My life
Yes, slightly telling that this came 3rd but hey - I’m writing a thesis and work pays the mortgage so what can you do!

I’m a father of two, husband to one, pack leader to one (a Mini Schnau) and friend to many.
