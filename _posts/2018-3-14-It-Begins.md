# And so it begins...

Yesterday I was assigned my supervisor for my MSS dissertation. Much excite.

My challenge, as well as doing my job (well), running a team (well), working through change, being a good dad, husband and pack leader is to write 20,000 words between now and 5 November 2018.

I won't ask you to hold my beer, as I want this to actually go well but goddam is 2018 going to be a crazy year.

The plan is to write about whether New Zealand should have a Vulnerabilities Equities Process. This will enable me to examine:
 * the importance of securtiy vulnerabilites to strategy and geopolitics in the information age
 * what a VEP should look like from a number of theoretical perspectives (small state theory, intelligence alliance theory, possibly Human Security?)
 * set out a lot of my thinking about the importance of disclosure and getting defects in systems fixed asap.

I've started a trello board to start to structure my chapters and the topics I want to cover. You can take a squiz at it here: [Should NZ have a VEP?](https://trello.com/b/kyzMiWUY/vulnerability-disclosure-dissertation)

I'm quite nervous about this, but the good thing is my supervisor is good, he's cool and he likes hip-hop so I'm sure I'm in good hands.

All I have to do is keep calm, read, plan, write and thrive.
Easy as.
